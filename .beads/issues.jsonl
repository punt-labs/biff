{"id":"biff-iok","title":"Phase 2: Network relay and team commands","description":"Enable cross-machine messaging and team-level commands via a hosted relay.\n\nSee prfaq.tex for authoritative product vision, phasing, and scope.\n\n## Architecture\n\npunt-labs runs the default hosted relay. Teams connect by having a .biff file in their repo with the relay URL. No accounts to create, no third-party services to sign up for — pip install biff-mcp + clone = connected.\n\nTeams that want data sovereignty can self-host the same relay.\n\n## Data Source Mapping\n\nEach command's data lives in one of two places: GitHub (persistent, repo-specific) or the relay (ephemeral/short-lived, real-time).\n\n| Command | Durability | Source | Notes |\n|---------|-----------|--------|-------|\n| /plan \"text\" | Persistent | GitHub | Like ~/.plan was a file. Survives sessions, disconnects, everything. |\n| /who | Ephemeral | Relay | Live presence. Only meaningful in real-time. |\n| /finger @user | Both | GitHub + Relay | Persistent plan from GitHub, online/offline from relay. |\n| /biff on/off | Ephemeral | Relay | Session-level toggle. Gone when you disconnect. |\n| /mesg @user | Store-and-forward | Relay | POP model: relay holds until read, then discards. |\n| /wall | Ephemeral | Relay | Miss it if you're offline. Matches UNIX. |\n| /hive | Ephemeral | Relay | Temporary group, dissolves on /hive off. |\n| /send @user | TBD | TBD | Design pending. |\n| /cr @user | TBD | TBD | Design pending. |\n| /talk @user | Ephemeral | Relay | Real-time conversation. No transcript. |\n| /pair @user | Ephemeral | Relay | Live session sharing. |\n\n## Relay Persistence Model: POP Mail\n\nThe relay follows a POP mail model — retrieve-and-delete:\n\n- Messages are stored on the relay only until the recipient reads them\n- Once read, the relay discards them. Biff is not a system of record.\n- Offline users' messages queue on the relay until they next connect\n- /wall is even simpler: ephemeral broadcast to connected clients, no storage at all\n\nThis is a thin persistence requirement. The relay needs a mailbox per user that drains on read, not a database.\n\nNATS JetStream consumers with ack-and-delete implement this pattern directly.\n\n## UNIX Lineage\n\nThe commands evoke BSD UNIX utilities but adapt where modern usage demands it:\n\n- /wall matches UNIX exactly: ephemeral broadcast, miss it if you're offline\n- /plan matches UNIX exactly: persistent file (was ~/.plan), readable via /finger\n- /mesg departs from UNIX write (which failed if user offline) toward mail semantics (store-and-forward), because async messaging between distributed developers requires queuing\n- /biff on/off matches UNIX biff: controls whether you receive notifications\n\n## Implementation Backend: Candidate Assessment\n\nThree options were evaluated for the relay. Research includes Python SDK maturity, hosting models, delivery guarantees, presence support, and self-hosting complexity.\n\n### Option A: Supabase (Postgres + Realtime + Presence)\n\n**Pros:**\n- Integrated auth, RLS, and Postgres — one platform for storage + realtime\n- Cheap at small scale ($0-25/mo for 100 users)\n- Free tier covers 200 concurrent connections, 2M messages\n- Broadcast latency is good (6ms median at 32k users)\n\n**Cons:**\n- No delivery guarantees. Docs: \"The server does not guarantee that every message will be delivered.\"\n- realtime-py stability issues. Archived Aug 2025. Silent data loss during reconnection.\n- Presence is ephemeral — status vanishes on disconnect.\n- Postgres Changes is single-threaded. No published throughput benchmarks.\n- Self-hosting = 13 Docker containers.\n- You'd build a message queue on Postgres anyway.\n\n**Verdict:** Reliability gaps make it unsuitable for store-and-forward messaging.\n\n### Option B: NATS + JetStream (Recommended)\n\n**Pros:**\n- Purpose-built for messaging. JetStream for persistence and delivery guarantees.\n- KV store for presence with TTL, watch API. Maps to /who, /finger. ~50 LOC.\n- JetStream consumers with ack-and-delete implement POP model directly.\n- Mature Python client: nats-py v2.13.1 (Feb 2026), 145K weekly PyPI downloads, full asyncio.\n- Self-hosting: single Go binary (\u003c20MB).\n- Managed hosting: Synadia Cloud (free personal, $49/mo starter).\n- Handles 100K msg/s on single node — far beyond Biff's needs.\n- Ephemeral-by-default messaging matches POP model.\n\n**Cons:**\n- No built-in presence. DIY with KV store + heartbeats (~50 LOC).\n- No built-in auth UI. User identity separate from connection auth.\n- Synadia Cloud free tier limited to 10 connections.\n- Self-hosters need monitoring setup.\n\n**Verdict:** Best fit. Messaging-first design, POP model maps directly to JetStream consumers, self-hosting is trivial.\n\n### Option C: Matrix Protocol (Eliminated)\n\nOver-engineered for this use case. Presence is resource-heavy, Python SDK immature, self-hosting requires a homeserver, federation adds unwanted complexity. See previous analysis.\n\n## Open Design Questions\n\n1. **Auth flow** — How do MCP servers authenticate to the relay? Per-user or per-team?\n2. **Reconnection strategy** — Replay missed messages from JetStream on reconnect?\n3. **Dual-mode conflict** — Can a local-only user and relay user on same team see each other?\n4. **Team isolation** — NATS subject hierarchy for multi-tenant relay?\n5. **Freemium model** — Default hosted relay should offer a free tier with volume limits, with option to bring your own Synadia/NATS account for higher usage.\n6. **/send and /cr** — Design pending. Data source and persistence model TBD.\n\n## Client Architecture\n\nNew module: biff.relay with:\n- RelayClient — wraps nats-py, handles connect/disconnect/send/subscribe\n- RelayMessageStore — POP model: pull unread, ack-and-delete\n- RelaySessionStore — presence via NATS KV store\n\nDual-mode: local (filesystem) or relay, selected by relay_url in .biff file.\n\n## Exit Criteria\n\nA distributed team can communicate end-to-end through biff across machines using the default hosted relay or their own self-hosted instance.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"jmf@pobox.com","created_at":"2026-02-13T15:25:26.267422-08:00","created_by":"\"jmf-pobox\"","updated_at":"2026-02-14T12:59:37.090916-08:00","labels":["epic","phase"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"biff-iok","depends_on_id":"biff-4rg","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-13T16:23:56.052507-08:00","created_by":"\"jmf-pobox\""}]}
