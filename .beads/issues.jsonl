{"id":"biff-6k7","title":"Spike: MCP notification rendering and subprocess handoff","description":"Validate two critical feasibility questions before committing to the full Phase 1 implementation.\n\n**Question 1: MCP notifications for receiving messages**\nCan an MCP server push a notification to Claude Code that renders visibly in the terminal? Test:\n- Create a minimal MCP server that fires a notification after a delay\n- Verify it appears in the Claude Code session without a tool call\n- Assess rendering quality (plain text? formatted? inline with conversation?)\n\n**Question 2: Subprocess handoff for /talk**\nCan an MCP server spawn an interactive subprocess that takes over terminal I/O, then return control to Claude Code cleanly? Test:\n- MCP tool call spawns a simple interactive process (e.g., a chat loop)\n- User types directly to the subprocess (no LLM intermediation)\n- Process exits, Claude Code resumes normally\n- Assess the UX transition (seamless or jarring?)\n\n**Exit criteria:**\n- Clear yes/no on both questions with evidence\n- If notifications work: document the API and rendering constraints\n- If subprocess handoff works: document the mechanism and UX quality\n- If either fails: document alternatives and revised approach for /mesg and /talk\n\n**Timeframe:** 1-2 days","notes":"Architecture analysis complete.
